---1.0
We are using .htaccess in /app  so that we are unable to access the .app folder in the browser.

---1.1
Because of the following line of code
RewriteRule  ^(.+)$ index.php?url=$1 [QSA,L]
in public/.htaccess
when pass a url param into our url we don't need knowlmvc/index.php?url=WHATEVER
instead we can just pass it in as follows knowlmvc/WHATEVER

---2.0
Side obvious Note. All of our controllers in our controllers dir will be classes.

---3.0
Good convention to have models className and file name singular ie. Post. While controllers className and file name plural.

--- 4.0
Notes for using Database class, models/pot.php and accessing values through public/index.php

<?php
//    This class ie Post is for demo, testing, and how to.
    class Post{
        private $db;

        public function __construct(){
            $this->db = new Database();
        }

        public function getPosts(){
            $this->db->query('SELECT * FROM posts');

            return $this->db->resultSet();

        }
    }


Pages.php
  class Pages extends Controller {
        public function __construct()
        {
            $this->postModel = $this->model('Post');
        }
        public function index(){

            $posts = $this->postModel->getPosts();

            $data = ['title'=> 'Welcome', 'posts'=> $posts];
//            we are passing in an array that we will then have access to in the view ie in the browser
            $this->view('pages/index', $data);

        }
        }

public/index.php
    <!--  FRONT END USES URLROOT, BACKEND USES APPROOT -->
    <?php require APPROOT . '/views/inc/header.php'; ?>

        <h1><?php echo $data['title']; ?></h1>
        <ul>
            <?php foreach($data['posts'] as $post) : ?>
                <li><?php echo $post->title; ?></li>
            <?php endforeach; ?>
        </ul>

    <?php require APPROOT . '/views/inc/footer.php'; ?>
